# How is the motor moving

This video shows how servo motors work! - If you’re interested it’s well worth a quick watch. 
*(You can watch it now or later on - up to you!)*

# Activity

## A simple program to make the motor move
We want to use the buttons to move the motor into different positions. To do this lets write a program

* Write the program below
* Download it to the micro:bit
* Check that the motor is moving correctly

>**Important Questions**
>* *What do you observe?*
>* *Which way is the motor rotating when you push the buttons?*

{{< details "**👉🏾 Answer**" >}}
1. When you push the button for zero degrees it should move clockwise
2. When you push the button for 180 degrees it should move anticlockwise
