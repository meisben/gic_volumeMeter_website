# Congratulations

You’ve finished the main activity! Well done. :tada:

## Extension challenges
If you’ve got this far, then here’s some additional challenges to keep you busy

1. **Get creative ->** make some kind of indicator to attach to the end of the volume meter
2. **Change the function of the buttons**, when you hold button A&B together they should move the motor to 90 degrees
3. **Change the display**. The display should show faces that get more angry as the sound gets louder
4. **Change what the motor is measuring**. Use acceleration instead of sound
